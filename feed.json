There's still lots of things needed to be managed, some features to be added, and (obviously) contents to be added.</p>\n<p>While i was aware of it, I was too focused in building the site to the point i forgot to plan it's contents. Hopefully it doesn't take too long for me to decide the content that i would like to post here. So, see you next time!</p>",
